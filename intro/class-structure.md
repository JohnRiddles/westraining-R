## Welcome to the R class!

### Overview 

The class is a general introduction to the R language. It does not intend to be
comprehensive, but it is very ambitious which means that we will cover a lot of ground in just three days. It also means that, sadly, we will not look into many details. I have preferred to give you an overview of a number of things that I find useful rather than delving into any particular issue. The decision is partly guided from the fact that I will not assume any background (or even interest) in computer programming. However, I will make the rather natural assumption that all of you have both experience with
statistics and with some statistical software.

The goal of the class is to provide you enough understanding about R to allow
you to run your own analysis. However, R and the way it works makes a lot more
sense when you think about it as a programming language. Because of that, I have
included some topics that are usually left out in some other introductions. This
should provide you the tools to further explore R on your own.

### Challenges

I encourage you to work on the problem sets between sessions. They are fairly
easy but they will help you consolidate what you have learned, especially considering that we will go very quickly over a lot of material. It is probably useful to remember that
learning a new language is essentially a matter of practice. The challenges also cover a
few things that I will not go over during the sessions, mostly to push you to
use the numerous resources that are available about R.

### Structure

_Day 1:_

- Overview of the language and resources
- Data types and data structures
- I/O and data manipulation

_Day 2:_

- Basic statistics and modeling
- Probability
- Figures

_Day 3:_

- Control flow statements
- Writing your own functions
- More data manipulation: split-apply-combine, merge, reshape, ...

### What's next?

There are a number of topics that are left out that have to do with a more advanced usage of R. 

- Object-oriented programming
- Environments
- Non-standard evaluation
- Package development

Some of them may be covered in an advanced class.
