### Challenge 2: Data analysis and graphics

1. Let's get some more information about the models that we plotted before.

	a. Read in the dataset on tobacco consumption, and estimate the parameters of the
	lin-log model between tobacco consumption and tax that we plotted before.

	b. Calculate the predicted values of the model in the previous sections with
	confidence intervals at the 99\% confidence level.

	c. Plot the predicted values you calculated above without using the `stat`
    and `formula` arguments.

	e. Estimate the parameters of the lin-log model above with fixed effects per
    state, and get the predictions using the average tax rate in that state.

2. Let's take a look at the Central Limit Theorem:

	a. Make 10 extractions of a balanced Bernoulli distribution and calculate
    the proportion of 1's.

	b. Replicate the experiment 1000 times.
	
	c. Create a histogram with the results of the experiment before.
