## Welcome to the Introduction to R Development class!

### Overview

The class is an introduction to statistical programming using R. The goal is not
just to present the main features of R development but also to explore some
tools that help produce reliable code. Because of that, the class puts a lot of
emphasis on additional tools to simplify the control, testing, and integration of
the R code base. 

The goal of the class it to provide you with a solid understanding of package
development in R. 

### Prerequisites
