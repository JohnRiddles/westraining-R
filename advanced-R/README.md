## Welcome to the "Introduction to R Development" class!

### Overview

The class is intended to be a first contact with the concepts that you need to
extend the `R` language. The goal is not just to present the main features of
`R` development but also to explore some tools that help produce reliable code.
I would like to think of the class as an introduction to statistical programming
in an open source environment. Because of that, the class puts a lot of emphasis
on additional tools to simplify the control, testing, and integration of the `R`
code base that are common in the open source community. 

### Prerequisites

Although it says "Introduction" in the title, it is introductory only for people
with previous experience in R or in software development. However, it is
essentially a practical class and therefore it will not involve advanced
programming concepts that are also probably outside my background.

### Structure

Day 1:
- A review of functions in R.

- Environments.

- Object-oriented programming using the S4 classes.

Day 2:
- The structure of R packages.

- Including C++ code.

- Documentation using `roxygen2`.

- Unit testing using `testhat`

Day 3: 
- Version control using `git`.

- GitHub and Continuous Integration in Travis.

- A reproducible workflow with `makefile`.

- Code coverage.
