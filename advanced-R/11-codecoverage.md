Code coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a test suite runs. It points developers towards the area in the code that need to increase coverage. During the process of writing tests the developer may discover new bugs or syntax issues in the source code that are important to resolve before distributing your application.

It can be expressed in lines of code were executed by a test suite.

1.  `hit` indicates the source code was executed by tests.
2.  `partial` indicates the source code was not fully executed and there are remaining branches that are not executed by the test suite.
3.  `miss` indicates the source code was not executed by the test suite.

Coverage is the ratio of total hits to lines of code.
