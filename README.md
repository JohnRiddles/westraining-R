# Materials for the R classes 

This repository contains most of the materials used in the introductory and
advanced classes to R at [Westat](https://www.westat.com/). 

The scripts are provided in Rmarkdown with a markdown output. The scripts are
grouped by topic and do not correspond to individual classes.

## Introduction to R 

The class covers the fundamentals of the language and some data manipulation
(split-apply-combine, merging, reshaping). It is oriented towards an audience
with previous experience in statistics but no background (or interest) in
computer programming. The goal of the class is not only to provide participants
with the ability to run studies in R but also to understand enough about the
language so that they can then explore new features on their own. 

The class was designed for a 3-day intensive seminar and includes a number of
exercises designed to cover a few details that are left out from the main
lecture and to encourage the participants to use the excellent documentation and
community-maintained resources available to R users.

## Advanced R

The class is adapted to the necessities of statistical programmers and covers
object-oriented programming using S3 and S4 classes and package development.

The class draws heavily from: 

- [The Art of R Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Programming-Statistical-Software-Design/dp/1593273843/), by Norman Matloff
- [Advanced R Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Chapman-Hall-CRC-Series/dp/1466586966), by Hadley Wickham.
