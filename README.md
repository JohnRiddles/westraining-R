# Training materials for the R classes at Westat

This repository contains most of the materials used in the introductory and
advanced classes to R at Westat. The scripts are provided in Rmarkdown with an
HTML output.

Both classes are in permanent work in progress. 

## Introduction to R 

The class covers the fundamentals of the language and some data manipulation
(split-apply-combine, merging, reshaping). It is oriented towards an audience
with previous experience in statistics but not background (or interest) in
computer programming. 

## Advanced R

The class is adapted to the necessities of statistical programmers and two main
topics. First, object-oriented programming using S3 and S4 classes and package
development. 

The class draws heavily from: 

- [The Art of R Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Programming-Statistical-Software-Design/dp/1593273843/), by Norman Matloff
- [Advanced R Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Chapman-Hall-CRC-Series/dp/1466586966), by Hadley Wickham.
